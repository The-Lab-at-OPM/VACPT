          American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples have rich diversity in their tribal affiliations, cultural customs, and languages. As of 2019, there are 573 federally recognized AI/AN tribes in the United States, and as many as 400 non-federally recognized tribes. About 334,000 U.S. Veterans identify as AI/AN alone or in combination with other races. Within AI/AN communities, Veterans are often given special respect similar to that of elders for having accepted the role of protector and experienced personal sacrifice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some understanding of AI/AN cultures will help you provide higher quality care when working with Veteran clients who identify with these cultures. The resources below delve further into these cultural areas. Ask questions about family, upbringing, languages, and spiritual beliefs to assess the extent to which Veterans identify with AI/AN culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mainstream belief systems influence how providers diagnose and treat health conditions. Examine your own belief system about AI/AN people as related to social issues, such as mental health stigma, education, poverty, teen suicide, and drug or alcohol use. How do your beliefs compare to the facts? What assumptions might you be making specifically about AI/AN Veterans? How does your own culture influence your interpretation of body language, oral communication, and other behavior?

          Basic facts
        </h2>
        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          In some ways, AI/AN Veterans have different experiences from other Veterans, in terms of reasons for serving, experience during service, and returning home.
        </h4>
        <p>
          AI/ANs may participate in the military to honor a warrior tradition, a tradition of accepting responsibility for protecting one's land and people.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI/AN Veterans are more likely to have served in combat positions. Large studies of AI/AN Veterans have shown they are about twice as likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder relative to White Veterans, a discrepancy explained by differential exposure to warzone stress.
        </p>
        <div class="cpt-section-read-more cpt-section-read-more__content" data-object="reveal-more">
          <p>
            Some AI/AN Veterans also report experience with stereotypes and discrimination during their military service. For AI/AN Veterans rooted in traditional community values, emphasis on aggression is in conflict with traditional values and practices.
          </p>
          <p>
            Trauma from natural disasters, accidents, and interpersonal violence is more common among AI/ANs than other populations. A context of trauma in the community, and of historical trauma to one’s people, may exacerbate PTSD.
          </p>
        </div>

        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          Historical precedent and continuing inequities give people from AI/AN communities reason to be guarded with outsiders.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Trauma from atrocious past events, including genocide and relocation, broken treaties, boarding schools and child removal policies has been passed across generations. Veterans may have further mistrust of mental health care, particularly government-sponsored care. Over time, try to improve your understanding of these issues, and acknowledge them.  To help establish trust from the very beginning, be open and sincere about yourself.  Listen carefully and calmly, honor your word, and be open to ideas about roots and paths to well-being that differ from your own.
        </p>

        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          Consider a Veteran’s health in the context of her/his community. What social determinants are factors? What resources can be leveraged to address them?
        </h4>
        <p>
          About 4 in 10 AI/AN Veterans reside in rural areas, more than Veterans of any other race, and thus face barriers to care characteristic of rural communities. Rural AI/AN communities face resource challenges, including employment and health care services that are distant, rural hospital closures, and other stressors, such as a lack of affordable housing, the influx of drugs into communities, rising costs, and low quality schools. These challenges may be exacerbated by other social factors such as lack of culturally responsive care.
        </p>

        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          Some barriers may be countered by the large degree of support for Veterans in many AI/AN communities. For example:
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Tribal council leaders</strong> may recommend traditional healers (if appropriate for your client) who can provide authentic healing ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Relationships with family</strong> and extended family are prominent in many AI/AN communities. Extended family might be available to provide social support.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Local Veterans organizations</strong> are another source of social support, and might be able to connect clients in your care with resources.
        </p>
        <div class="cpt-section-read-more cpt-section-read-more__content" data-object="reveal-more">
          <p>
            <strong>Local tribes</strong> may provide additional assistance obtaining services and benefits. Encourage the Veterans you serve to contact their local tribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Telehealth programs</strong> have been established in collaboration with some AI/AN communities. Read more about these in the Resource Library.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Connection to culture:</strong> For many AI/AN Veterans culture is healing. Despite the trauma that AI/AN populations have endured, they have maintained strong, healthy traditions. Some tribes have ceremonies to welcome home Veterans and help them re-enter the community.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Holistic beliefs about health:</strong> Many (but not all) AI/ANs approach healing holistically (i.e. mind, body, and spirit) and frequently incorporate traditional healing methods (e.g. ceremonies, talking circles) with Western medicine. These methods are often facilitated by a healer and frequently involve investment of time and resources by the client’s family.

The first section is designed for individual service providers who are working with AI/AN clients and communities, to improve cultural competence. Vignettes are provided for demonstration. The second section is an implementation guide for behavioral health program administrators who are looking to form more culturally responsive policies, procedures, and practices.

          Indian Health Service
        </h4>
        <p>
          AI/AN Veterans often qualify for services from both the Veterans Health Administration and the Indian Health Service. Misperception about care eligibility being “either/or” can result in Veterans being turned away for care. Inform your staff that some Veterans may have dual eligibility at Veterans Health Administration and Indian Health Service. Empower Veterans to use both systems, but remember that there may be some limitations on eligibility.
        </p>
        <p>
          Veterans unsure of their eligibility can use resources available through each agency to determine if they qualify for care:

          Resources at local VA facilities
        </h4>
        <p>
          Some VA facilities that serve a higher percentage of AI/AN Veterans offer specific programs for this population, which may include mental telehealth clinics as well as linkages with traditional healing endorsed by local tribes, care coordination, and benefit services navigation.
        </p>
        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          Representatives at VA facilities and beyond
        </h4>
        <p>
          Other individuals and organizations advocate for AI/AN Veterans and assist them in obtaining VA benefits.  The following representatives give Veterans choices about where to seek help, depending on proximity, level of comfort, and past experience (none accept payment for services):
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Veterans Service Organization (VSO) Representatives:</strong> Accredited VSOs are particularly helpful when a Veteran requires assistance with filing a benefits claim or responding to a denied claim. VSOs represent Veterans in the claims process. They also have the ability to track a claim from beginning to end and to act as power of attorney, and they can assist with access to other VA and community resources. VSO representatives are usually Veterans themselves, often volunteers with non-profit organizations. As of 2017, a tribe may have its own VA-accredited VSO, akin to state VSOs. Additionally, other accredited VSOs may be located near tribal communities.
        </p>
        <div class="cpt-section-read-more cpt-section-read-more__content" data-object="reveal-more">
          <p>
            <strong>Tribal Veterans Representatives (TVRs):</strong> Tribal Veterans Representatives are excellent resources for Veterans who live in remote communities and thus find it difficult to access the VA or VSOs.  They are volunteers (not employees) trained by VA who help Veterans and their families access VA, federal, state, tribal, and non-government resources. TVRs often live in tribal communities. They can meet at times and places convenient for the Veteran. The TVR role was created to build knowledge and trust in accessing VA services from within tribal communities. Contact tribal leadership to find out if representatives are available in your client’s community.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Minority Veterans Program Coordinators (MVPCs):</strong> Minority Veterans Program Coordinators might be particularly helpful for Veterans who have encountered gaps in or barriers to VA care and benefits.  MVPCs serve Veterans from a variety of backgrounds, outreaching to promote their use of VA benefits and services. As VA employees, MVPCs can provide warm hand-offs to program specialists in the VA and can advocate within their VA facility to improve service delivery. Supported by the Center for Minority Veterans, MVPCs are located at VA health care facilities, regional benefit offices, and national cemeteries and can be contacted directly by email.
