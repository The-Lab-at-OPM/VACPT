          American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples have rich diversity in their tribal affiliations, cultural customs, and languages. As of 2019, there are 573 federally recognized AI/AN tribes in the United States, and as many as 400 non-federally recognized tribes. About 334,000 U.S. Veterans identify as AI/AN alone or in combination with other races. Within AI/AN communities, Veterans are often given special respect similar to that of elders for having accepted the role of protector and experienced personal sacrifice.

          Some understanding of AI/AN cultures will help you provide higher quality care when working with Veteran clients who identify with these cultures. The resources below delve further into these cultural areas. Ask questions about family, upbringing, languages, and spiritual beliefs to assess the extent to which Veterans identify with AI/AN culture.

          Mainstream belief systems influence how providers diagnose and treat health conditions. Examine your own belief system about AI/AN people as related to social issues, such as mental health stigma, education, poverty, teen suicide, and drug or alcohol use. How do your beliefs compare to the facts? What assumptions might you be making specifically about AI/AN Veterans? How does your own culture influence your interpretation of body language, oral communication, and other behavior?
