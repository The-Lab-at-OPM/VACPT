        American Indian and Alaska Native Veterans

      <p class="cpt-section__lead">
        Veterans from American Indian and Alaska Native populations have an exemplary tradition of military service and sacrifice, serving at one of the highest rates per capita of any ethnic group.

          American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) peoples have rich diversity in their tribal affiliations, cultural customs, and languages. As of 2019, there are 573 federally recognized AI/AN tribes in the United States, and as many as 400 non-federally recognized tribes. About 334,000 U.S. Veterans identify as AI/AN alone or in combination with other races. Within AI/AN communities, Veterans are often given special respect similar to that of elders for having accepted the role of protector and experienced personal sacrifice.

        <p>
          Some understanding of AI/AN cultures will help you provide higher quality care when working with Veteran clients who identify with these cultures. The resources below delve further into these cultural areas. Ask questions about family, upbringing, languages, and spiritual beliefs to assess the extent to which Veterans identify with AI/AN culture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mainstream belief systems influence how providers diagnose and treat health conditions. Examine your own belief system about AI/AN people as related to social issues, such as mental health stigma, education, poverty, teen suicide, and drug or alcohol use. How do your beliefs compare to the facts? What assumptions might you be making specifically about AI/AN Veterans? How does your own culture influence your interpretation of body language, oral communication, and other behavior?

          Basic facts
        </h2>
        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          In some ways, AI/AN Veterans have different experiences from other Veterans, in terms of reasons for serving, experience during service, and returning home.
        </h4>
        <p>
          AI/ANs may participate in the military to honor a warrior tradition, a tradition of accepting responsibility for protecting one's land and people.
        </p>
        <p>
          AI/AN Veterans are more likely to have served in combat positions. Large studies of AI/AN Veterans have shown they are about twice as likely to have post-traumatic stress disorder relative to White Veterans, a discrepancy explained by differential exposure to warzone stress.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some AI/AN Veterans also report experience with stereotypes and discrimination during their military service. For AI/AN Veterans rooted in traditional community values, emphasis on aggression is in conflict with traditional values and practices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trauma from natural disasters, accidents, and interpersonal violence is more common among AI/ANs than other populations. A context of trauma in the community, and of historical trauma to one’s people, may exacerbate PTSD.
        </p>

        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          Historical precedent and continuing inequities give people from AI/AN communities reason to be guarded with outsiders.
        </h4>
        <p>
          Trauma from atrocious past events, including genocide and relocation, broken treaties, boarding schools and child removal policies has been passed across generations. Veterans may have further mistrust of mental health care, particularly government-sponsored care. Over time, try to improve your understanding of these issues, and acknowledge them.  To help establish trust from the very beginning, be open and sincere about yourself.  Listen carefully and calmly, honor your word, and be open to ideas about roots and paths to well-being that differ from your own.
        </p>

        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          Consider a Veteran’s health in the context of her/his community. What social determinants are factors? What resources can be leveraged to address them?
        </h4>
        <p>
          About 4 in 10 AI/AN Veterans reside in rural areas, more than Veterans of any other race, and thus face barriers to care characteristic of rural communities. Rural AI/AN communities face resource challenges, including employment and health care services that are distant, rural hospital closures, and other stressors, such as a lack of affordable housing, the influx of drugs into communities, rising costs, and low quality schools. These challenges may be exacerbated by other social factors such as lack of culturally responsive care.
        </p>

        <h4 class="cpt-section__lead-alt">
          Some barriers may be countered by the large degree of support for Veterans in many AI/AN communities. For example:
        </h4>
        <p>
          <strong>Tribal council leaders</strong> may recommend traditional healers (if appropriate for your client) who can provide authentic healing ceremonies.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Relationships with family</strong> and extended family are prominent in many AI/AN communities. Extended family might be available to provide social support.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Local Veterans organizations</strong> are another source of social support, and might be able to connect clients in your care with resources.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Local tribes</strong> may provide additional assistance obtaining services and benefits. Encourage the Veterans you serve to contact their local tribe.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Telehealth programs</strong> have been established in collaboration with some AI/AN communities. Read more about these in the Resource Library.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Connection to culture:</strong> For many AI/AN Veterans culture is healing. Despite the trauma that AI/AN populations have endured, they have maintained strong, healthy traditions. Some tribes have ceremonies to welcome home Veterans and help them re-enter the community.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Holistic beliefs about health:</strong> Many (but not all) AI/ANs approach healing holistically (i.e. mind, body, and spirit) and frequently incorporate traditional healing methods (e.g. ceremonies, talking circles) with Western medicine. These methods are often facilitated by a healer and frequently involve investment of time and resources by the client’s family.

          <a class="cpt-section__link" href="#samhsa">The SAMHSA Culture Card</a> was designed by Public Health Service Officers, tribal community members, and AI/AN behavioral health professionals to enhance cultural competence while serving AI/AN communities. Content includes roles of Veterans and Elders, strengths in AI/AN communities, wellness challenges, and self-awareness and etiquette.

          SAMHSA’s <a class="cpt-section__link" href="#treatment">Treatment Improvement Protocol 61</a> is a detailed tool for behavioral health service providers who want to enhance their cultural competence in relationships with AI/ANs. The first section is designed for individual service providers who are working with AI/AN clients and communities, to improve cultural competence. Vignettes are provided for demonstration. The second section is an implementation guide for behavioral health program administrators who are looking to form more culturally responsive policies, procedures, and practices.
